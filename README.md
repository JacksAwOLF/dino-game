# dino-game

End goal: chrome extension that plays the no-wifi-dino game for you. 

Right now, a simple python script that takes screenshots as fast as python can (which is pretty slow)
and makes the dinosaur jump when it sees a black pixel in a bounding box specified manually

(the jump is also timed according to a updating variable that slowly increases... so one would have to restart the script for every new game.)
